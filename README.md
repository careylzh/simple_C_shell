Task 3 is cray cray

2 branches with unrelated histories because i:

git clone an existing repository, initialised new repo with readmefile, changed remote branch to this branch 

so 2 different commit histories (nat's repo vs my repo with readme)

fixed by:
git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories on main(the readme one from main)
