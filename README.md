Task 3 is cray cray









## Misc
There were 2 branches had unrelated histories because i:
git clone an existing repository, initialised new repo with readmefile, changed remote branch to this branch 
so 2 different commit histories (nat's repo vs my repo with readme)
fixed by:
git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories on main(the readme one from main)
